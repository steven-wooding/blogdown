Thinking It Through is an attempt to take the mindset of a researcher and apply it to everyday life, and to create something along the way. Thinking things through takes time and energy, hopefully other people will find the end result useful, and maybe even entertaining.

The site is written by Steven Wooding, a parent, partner and policy researcher based in Cambridge, UK - who is slightly concerned about referring to himself in the third person.
