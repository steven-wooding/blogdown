Dr Steven Wooding is a Senior Policy Analyst in the Research Strategy Office at the University of Cambridge; an Affiliated Researcher at the Bennett Institute for Public Policy; a Visiting Research Fellow at the Centre for Science Policy and a Senior Research Associated at the Intellectual Forum at Jesus College. His central research interest is how research itself works: from funding processes; to the social machinery of research and the wider impact of research. 

He has recently looked at the evidence behind using peer review for funding allocation, and worked with foundations to develop improved methods of selecting research projects to boost innovation. Alongside his research interests Steve is lead for Outputs for the University of Cambridge’s submission for REF2021. Steve has broader interests in the use of evidence in policy; and approaches to visualising concepts and data. Previously, Steve worked at the Centre for Science Policy as Lead for Research; and at RAND Europe where he was Director of the Innovation Health and Science team. He advises on various projects around the assessment of research.
