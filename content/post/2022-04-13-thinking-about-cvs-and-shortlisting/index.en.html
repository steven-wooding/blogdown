<h1>What are we measuring</h1>
<p>We’re assuming that there are a series of characteristics or competencies that determine how good a scientist a person is. To start with I’m going to assume there are two different ‘buckets’ of characteristics: narrow academic achievement which I’ll call <code>A</code> (publications, grants, that sort of thing); and secondly wider working skills, which I’ll call <code>W</code> around mentoring, leadership, contributions to the community.</p>
<p>To start with we’re going to assume these characteristics aren’t correlated. And that the overall ranking of the candidates consists of a linear combination of the two skills, but the weighting of the different skill sets differs depending on the format of the CV - and in this case that the narrative CV increases the weight given to wider skills, so that candidates with good wider skills do <em>better</em> when assessed with narrative CVs as their skills are noticed.</p>
<p>(Alternatively we could assume it is just that each type of skill can be more accurately assessed by the different formats of CVs).</p>
<p>Let’s assume each is equivalently normally distributed mean = 100, standard deviation = 20.</p>
<p>Now let’s take 20 candidates.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>num_candidates &lt;- 20

candidates &lt;- data.frame(name = letters[1:num_candidates], A = rnorm(num_candidates, mean = 100, sd = 20), W = rnorm(num_candidates, mean = 100, sd = 20))

ggplot(candidates, aes(x = A, y = W)) +
  geom_point()</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Each of these candidates prepares a classical academic CV and a narrative CV. We assume in this first example that:
1) For the classical CV the academic skill contributes more to the overall assessment
2) For the narrative CV the wider skills contribute more to the overall assessment
And for each assessment there is an inaccuracy in this assessment - ie an error term. We assume this error term is for the overall assessment. This gives two expressions for perceived ability - that when assessed by a classical CV <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and when assessed with a narrative CV <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{C}_{i}=\mathrm{A}_{i} + \gamma\mathrm{W}_{i} + \epsilon\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N}_{i}=\mathrm{A}_{i} + \nu\mathrm{W}_{i} + \epsilon\)</span></p>
<p>(It might be better to assume that the error in the assessment of the different skills are different types for the different types of CV - ie that for a classical CV, academic skill can be assessed for accurately)</p>
<p>[Complexity to add: these assessments will be made by different people]</p>
<p>Let’s assuming <span class="math inline">\(\gamma=0.2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\nu=0.5\)</span> the error has mean = 0 and sd = 5.</p>
